# Contribution Guidelines

I welcome contributions to ExTwilio. Contributors should keep in mind the following rules:

- Pull requests will not be accepted if the Travis build is failing.
- Code changes should be accompanied with test changes or additions to validate that your changes actually work.
- Code changes must update inline documentation in all relevant areas. Users rely on this documentation.
- Any code you submit will be subject to the MIT license.
- Discussion must be courteous at all times. Offending discussions will be closed and locked.
